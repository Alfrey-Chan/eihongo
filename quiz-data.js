      "explanation": {
        "correct_answer": "「迷惑」(meiwaku) means 'trouble', 'bother', or 'annoyance'. It's used when someone's actions cause inconvenience or discomfort to others. In this context, speaking loudly on the phone in a bus is causing annoyance to other passengers.",
        "option_explanations": {
          "A": "「迷惑」(meiwaku) is correct. It perfectly describes the situation where someone's inconsiderate behavior (talking loudly on the phone) is bothering others in a public space.",
          "B": "「無理」(muri) means 'impossible', 'unreasonable', or 'forcing oneself'. While it can indicate something troublesome, it doesn't specifically refer to bothering others, which is what this context requires.",
          "C": "「残念」(zannen) means 'regrettable' or 'disappointing'. It expresses a feeling of disappointment but doesn't convey the concept of causing trouble to others.",
          "D": "「心配」(shinpai) means 'worry' or 'concern'. It refers to feeling anxious about someone or something, not causing annoyance to others."
        }
      },
      "additional_information": "「迷惑」is a very important cultural concept in Japanese society, where being considerate of others is highly valued. The term appears in many common expressions like 「迷惑をかける」(to cause trouble to others) and 「迷惑行為」(nuisance behavior). Understanding this concept is crucial for navigating social situations in Japan appropriately."

          "is_correct": false
        }
      ],
      "explanation": {
        "correct_answer": "「よけに」(yoke ni) is a dialectal expression (particularly from western Japan, including Kansai) that means 'just in case' or 'as a precaution'. It's used when taking extra measures to prepare for a possible situation.",
        "option_explanations": {
          "A": "「よけに」is correct. It perfectly fits this context where you're suggesting someone take an umbrella as a precautionary measure in case it rains.",
          "B": "「わざと」(wazato) means 'deliberately' or 'on purpose' and implies intentionally doing something that might not be expected or necessary. This doesn't fit the context of preparing for possible rain.",
          "C": "「むしろ」(mushiro) means 'rather' or 'instead' and is used to present an alternative or contrasting idea. It doesn't work here because there's no contrasting option being presented.",
          "D": "「あえて」(aete) means 'deliberately' or 'intentionally' with a nuance of doing something despite difficulties or against expectations. This doesn't match the precautionary nature of the umbrella suggestion."
        }
      },
      "additional_information": "「よけに」is primarily used in western Japanese dialects, especially Kansai-ben. In standard Japanese (標準語/hyōjungo), equivalent expressions would include 「念のため」(nen no tame) or 「万が一のために」(man ga ichi no tame ni). This is a good example of how Japanese dialects can have unique vocabulary that may not be widely understood in other regions of Japan. The word comes from 「予け」(yoke), meaning 'preparation' or 'precaution'."

        }
      ],
      "explanation": {
        "correct_answer": "「限り」(kagiri) in this pattern means 'as far as (I know)' or 'to the extent of (my knowledge)'. It's used to qualify a statement based on the limits of one's knowledge or experience.",
        "option_explanations": {
          "A": "「限り」is correct. The pattern 「〜する限り」indicates the extent or limit of something, in this case 'as far as I know' or 'to the extent of my knowledge', which appropriately qualifies the statement about the person never having lied.",
          "B": "「ほど」(hodo) indicates a degree or extent and is used in patterns like 「〜するほど」(the more... the more...) or to indicate comparison. It doesn't fit grammatically or semantically in this sentence structure.",
          "C": "「まで」(made) means 'until' or 'up to' and is used to indicate a limit in time, space, or extent. While it can indicate limits, it doesn't work in this grammatical pattern to express 'as far as I know'.",
          "D": "「くらい」(kurai) indicates an approximate amount or degree, similar to 'about' or 'around'. It doesn't fit in this context where you're expressing the limitation of your knowledge."
        }
      },
      "additional_information": "The pattern 「〜限り」(~kagiri) is very useful in Japanese for qualifying statements. Other common uses include 「できる限り」(dekiru kagiri - as much as possible), 「命ある限り」(inochi aru kagiri - as long as I live), and 「時間の許す限り」(jikan no yurusu kagiri - as time permits). This pattern helps speakers avoid making absolute statements, which aligns with the Japanese cultural preference for expressing things with appropriate levels of certainty."

        }
      ],
      "explanation": {
        "correct_answer": "「意外と」(igai to) means 'surprisingly' or 'unexpectedly'. It's used when something contradicts expectations or preconceptions.",
        "option_explanations": {
          "A": "「意外と」is correct. It perfectly captures the contrast between the poor reputation of the movie and the speaker's actual experience of finding it interesting, indicating surprise at this unexpected outcome.",
          "B": "「当然」(touzen) means 'naturally' or 'of course' and indicates that something is expected or obvious. This contradicts the context where the movie was better than its reputation suggested.",
          "C": "「むしろ」(mushiro) means 'rather' or 'instead' and is used to present a contrasting alternative. While this could work grammatically, it doesn't capture the element of surprise that 「意外と」conveys, which is central to the meaning here.",
          "D": "「わりに」(wari ni) means 'relatively' or 'fairly' and indicates a moderate degree compared to something else. While this could fit grammatically, it lacks the element of surprise or contradiction of expectations that is central to the context."
        }
      },
      "additional_information": "「意外と」is frequently used in Japanese to express when reality differs from expectations. It's similar to 「思ったより」(omotta yori - more than I thought) but has a stronger nuance of surprise. A related expression is 「案外」(angai), which also means 'unexpectedly' but is slightly more formal. These expressions are important for expressing subjective reactions in Japanese conversation and help convey the speaker's emotional response to situations that defy expectations."

      "explanation": {
        "correct_answer": "「体を張って」(karada wo hatte) literally means 'putting one's body on the line' and is used to describe taking physical risks or making significant personal sacrifices for a cause or belief.",
        "option_explanations": {
          "A": "「体を張って」is correct. It indicates that the person participated in the protest despite potential physical risks or personal consequences, showing strong commitment to their beliefs.",
          "B": "「身を捨てて」(mi wo sutete) means 'throwing away one's life' or 'abandoning oneself' and has a more extreme connotation of complete self-sacrifice, often with a nuance of abandoning all personal concerns. This is too strong for the context of joining a protest.",
          "C": "「命を懸けて」(inochi wo kakete) means 'risking one's life' or 'at the risk of one's life' and suggests a life-or-death situation. This is too extreme for most protest contexts unless it's in a particularly dangerous environment.",
          "D": "「手を尽くして」(te wo tsukushite) means 'doing everything possible' or 'making every effort' but lacks the physical risk or personal sacrifice nuance that 「体を張って」conveys. It focuses more on thoroughness of effort rather than risk."
        }
      },
      "additional_information": "「体を張る」(karada wo haru) is a common Japanese idiom that literally means to 'stretch out one's body' but is used to describe putting oneself at physical risk or making personal sacrifices for a cause. It's less extreme than expressions involving risking one's life but still conveys serious commitment. This expression appears frequently in news reporting and political discourse to describe activists, whistleblowers, or others who take personal risks for their beliefs. Related expressions include 「身を挺して」(mi wo teishite - putting oneself forward) which has a similar meaning."
