# Language Learning AI Quiz App - Development Journal

  ## Project Overview
  Building a useful quiz app for language learners while mastering frontend development fundamentals.

  ## Learning Path
  1. **Phase 1**: HTML5 semantic structure and accessibility
  2. **Phase 2**: Modern CSS (Grid, Flexbox, Variables)
  3. **Phase 3**: Vanilla JavaScript and DOM manipulation
  4. **Phase 4**: Responsive design and mobile optimization
  5. **Phase 5**: Theme system and advanced features

  ## Current Progress
  - [x] Project setup and documentation
  - [x] Git repository initialization
  - [ ] HTML5 semantic structure
  - [ ] CSS variables and reset
  - [ ] Navigation components
  - [ ] Quiz functionality
  - [ ] Theme switching
  - [ ] Mobile responsiveness

  ## Technical Decisions
  - **Framework**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (learning fundamentals first)
  - **Approach**: Mobile-first responsive design
  - **Architecture**: Component-based CSS with BEM methodology
  - **Theme System**: CSS custom properties for dark/light modes

  ## Next Steps
  1. Create HTML5 semantic structure
  2. Set up CSS variables and reset
  3. Build navigation components
  4. Implement quiz functionality

  ## Notes & Reminders
  - Commit frequently with descriptive messages
  - Focus on accessibility and semantic HTML
  - Learn CSS fundamentals before frameworks
  - Document learning process and decisions

  üîÑ Context Management Strategy

  CLAUDE.md Update Schedule:

  - After each major component (HTML structure, CSS setup, etc.)
  - When making technical decisions (architecture choices)
  - At end of each coding session (progress and next steps)
  - When encountering problems (solutions and lessons learned)

  Key Context to Maintain:

  - Current learning focus and phase
  - Technical decisions and reasoning
  - Progress checklist and completed features
  - Next immediate steps and goals
  - Problems solved and lessons learned
